# Chess-Game
A  classic chess game built from the ground up using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was created to demonstrate core web development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic implementation.

The game features a standard 8x8 board and leverages jQuery to simplify the JavaScript logic for piece movement and player interactions.
